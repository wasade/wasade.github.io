I am an [Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology](http://iqbiology.colorado.edu)
graduate student under the [BioFrontiers Institute](http://biofrontiers.colorado.edu),
and a Computer Science graduate student at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://colorado.edu).
Since 2004, I have been under the mentorship of [Dr. Rob Knight](http://knightlab.colorado.edu). My
general interests are in using computation to help answer questions relevant to
the life sciences. More specifically, I am interested in microbial diversity
and how environmental parameters shape microbial assemblages.

Please check out the [American Gut Project](http://americangut.org) and learn how to contribute your poop to science! Here's the [results](http://www.microbio.me/americangut/img/results/000004216.pdf) of one of my samples taken a day after eating a pile of thai chilis on an empty stomach. Because, science.
