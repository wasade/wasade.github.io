My name is Daniel McDonald, and I am an [Interdisciplinary Quantitative
Biology](http://iqbiology.colorado.edu) graduate student in the
[BioFrontiers Institute](http://biofrontiers.colorado.edu), and a Computer
Science graduate student at the [University of Colorado in
Boulder](http://colorado.edu).  Since 2004, I have been under the mentorship of
[Dr. Rob Knight](http://knightlab.colorado.edu). My general interests are in
using computation to help answer questions relevant to the life sciences. More
specifically, I am interested in microbial diversity and how environmental
parameters shape microbial assemblages.

Please check out the [American Gut Project](http://americangut.org) and learn
how to contribute your poop to science! Here's the
[results](http://www.microbio.me/americangut/img/results/000004216.pdf) of one
of my samples taken a day after eating a pile of thai chilis on an empty
stomach. Because, science.
