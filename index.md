My name is Daniel McDonald, and I study poop. My primary interest is in the
relationship between the microbiome and human health. I'm currently a postdoc
at the University of California, San Diego in the Department of Pediatrics and
will be starting at the Institute for Systems Biology on November 9th, 2015 in
the [Price Lab](https://price.systemsbiology.org/). 

Between 2004 and 2015, I was under the mentorship of [Dr. Rob
Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/). During that time, I received a BS and PhD
in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado
Boulder](http://colorado.edu) and an [Interdisciplinary Quantitative
Biology](http://iqbiology.colorado.edu) certificate from the [BioFrontiers
Institute](http://biofrontiers.colorado.edu/). My dissertation was on the
development of a microbiome reference that spans thousands of individuals with
a focus on the [American Gut Project](http://americangut.org). I am the former
Project Manager for the American Gut having overseen it from June 2013 to
August 2015. You can find one of my samples [here](assets/img/000004216.pdf)
which was taken a day after eating a pile of thai chilis on an empty stomach.
Because, science.
