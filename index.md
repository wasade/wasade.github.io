I study poop, with supercomputers, after its been handled by robots. Sometimes lasers are involved too. 

To do this, I work with an international group of researchers on the design of novel research studies, and the development
of analytical software. As a developer, researcher and educator, I am firmly committed to open source licenses, open
access projects, and outreach both within and external to the scientific community.

I am long running member of the [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/), a former project manager for the [American Gut Project](http://americangut.org), a researcher deeply involved in the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org), and my poop can be found [here](assets/img/000004216.pdf) (following a lot of thai chilis, because, science).
